# Cleanup Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. Removed Old Classification Files
- ❌ `model.py` (old classification model) → replaced with regression model
- ❌ `train_scoring.py` → replaced with `train.py`
- ❌ `run_training.py` (old) → replaced with new version
- ❌ `run_optimized_training.py` → removed
- ❌ `test_fixes.py` → removed
- ❌ `train_regression.py` → consolidated into `train.py`
- ❌ `train_regression_simple.py` → removed (synthetic data version)
- ❌ `run_regression_training.py` → consolidated into `run_training.py`
- ❌ `test_regression_approach.py` → removed (demo only)
- ❌ `REGRESSION_FIX_README.md` → content merged into main README

### 2. Kept Essential Files
- ✅ `model.py` - Now contains regression model only
- ✅ `train.py` - Main training script using real data
- ✅ `run_training.py` - Simple runner script
- ✅ `feature_utils.py` - Feature extraction (unchanged)
- ✅ `data_utils.py` - Data utilities (unchanged)
- ✅ `__init__.py` - Updated imports for regression
- ✅ `README.md` - Updated documentation

### 3. Key Changes
- Now uses REAL model predictions via `collect_predictions`
- Proper regression loss with coverage, efficiency, and calibration
- 17-dimensional features (13 geometric + 4 uncertainty)
- Tau calculated from normalized residuals
- Outputs interval widths, not classification scores

```

## How to Run
```bash
cd /ssd_4TB/divake/conformal-od
python learnable_scoring_fn/run_training.py
```

This will:
1. Load real predictions from your trained model
2. Train a regression model to predict interval widths
3. Save results to `experiments/real_data_v1/`
